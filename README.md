# README #

WakeMapper is a program that interacts with the video game Alan Wake (by Remedy Entertainment) to display the player's position on a map.

The program will only read data from the video game, it will not modify it in any way. The map is displayed in the program's own window.

To download and and run the program immediately, get the program from here: https://bitbucket.org/Sofox/wakemapper/downloads/WakeMapper.exe

The program is standalone, no installation needed.

The map itself comes from a scan of official merchandise (as seen here: http://alanwake.wikia.com/wiki/Bright_Falls ) combined with an in game texture of an in game wallmap.

### Build Instructions ###

The program is built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015. This program should be able to open the project files and build the program.

Visual Studio Community can be freely downloaded from: https://www.visualstudio.com , although it may require registration.

Once installed, and the project file opened, it should be able to be built and run at the click of a button.
