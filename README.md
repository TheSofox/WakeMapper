You can download a binary program here: https://bitbucket.org/Sofox/wakemapper/downloads/WakeMapper.exe

The program is standalone, and runs without needing an install.

The map inside the program comes from a scan of official merchandise (as seen here: http://alanwake.wikia.com/wiki/Bright_Falls ) combined with an in game texture of an in game wallmap.

### Build Instructions ###

The program is built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015. This program should be able to open open, build and run the program.

Visual Studio Community can be freely downloaded from: https://www.visualstudio.com , although it may require registration.

Otherwise of course, you can just download the binary: https://bitbucket.org/Sofox/wakemapper/downloads/WakeMapper.exe
