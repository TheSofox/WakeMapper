You can download a binary here: https://bitbucket.org/Sofox/wakemapper/downloads/WakeMapper.exe

The program is standalone, and runs without needing an install.

The map inside the program comes from a scan of official merchandise (as seen here: http://alanwake.wikia.com/wiki/Bright_Falls ) combined with an in game texture of an in game wallmap.

### Build Instructions ###

The program is built using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015. This program should be able to open open, build and run the program.
