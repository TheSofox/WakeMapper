# README #

WakeMapper is a program that interacts with video games to display the player's position on a map. The program currently supports Alan Wake, Firewatch and Skyrim Special Edition. (The Long Dark used to be supported, but various new releases broke compatibility).

### Map credits ###
The Alan Wake map comes from a scan of official merchandise (as seen here: http://alanwake.wikia.com/wiki/Bright_Falls ) combined with an in game texture of an in game wallmap.

The Firewatch map technically comes from an in game texture, but more accurately comes from a "clean" high res version of that texture provided by the game's developers: http://blog.camposanto.com/post/140041752129/downloadable-printable-firewatch-maps-for-you-a

The Long Dark maps, with the exception of the overview map (provided by the dev team), were created by Whiteberry (@toarda). You can see all her maps (including some versions that have more information) here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530202531

Skyrim map provided by GameBanshee: http://www.gamebanshee.com/skyrim/mapofskyrim.php (link provides high quality version of map and text index of locations)

### Game Credits ###

Alan Wake created by Remedy Entertainment

Firewatch created by Campo Santo

The Long Dark created by Hinterland Games

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition created by Bethesda Game Studios

### Technical information ###

The Steam version of all games were tested with this program on a 64 bit Windows 7 PC

GIMP image editor was often used to edit, tweak and scale maps.

Cheat Engine ( http://www.cheatengine.org ) played an invaluable part in finding the player position values in memory, and helping me access them even if the game restarts.
